# Sequences in Python: Lists, Tuples, and Sets

Summary of essential sequence types in Python: **lists**, **tuples**, and **sets**.  
Coverage focuses on characteristics, core operations, and recommended usage, referencing material from the lesson notebooks.

## Structure

```
06_sequences/
    |- a)_lists.ipynb             # Lists: creation, mutability, operations, comprehensions
    |- b)_tuples.ipynb            # Tuples: immutability, indexing, slicing
    |- c)_sets.ipynb              # Sets: uniqueness, union, intersection, difference
README.md
```

## Usage Recommendations

- Use **lists** for ordered, changeable collections.
- Use **tuples** for grouped values that must remain unchanged.
- Use **sets** for collections where each element must be unique and for set operations.
