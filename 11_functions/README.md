# Python Functions: Reference and Guide

A focused reference on functions in Python.  
Includes declaration, usage, optional and positional arguments, return values, scope, and common patterns for clean and reusable code.

## Best Practices

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Avoid side effects (changing variables outside).
- Use return values for outputs instead of print, when possible.
- Document your functions with docstrings.
