# üêç Python Fundamentals ‚Äì STI Data Engineering Program

This repository contains my coursework for Python Fundamentals at Stockholms Tekniska Institut (STI), part of the Data Engineering program (2025‚Äì2027).

The course builds a solid foundation in Python programming, focusing on problem-solving, data logic, and software development best practices. Although beginner-level, it integrates early exposure to data engineering workflows, including data processing, data visualization, version control, and environment management.
